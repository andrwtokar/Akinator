# Akinator
My first significant project.
Play "Akinator" can guess word on playing tree.
You build tree in play process and save it in file.

The code in the files uses russian letters and was written in Cyrillic encoding (1251).
This is not fatal to enable the program, since we are translating the console into Cyrillic encoding. But if your IDE encoding is different from Cyrillic (1251), then the code will not display correctly in your development environment.

In the future, upon entering the game, there will be rules that will explain the controversial issues and the rules for using the Russian language by a computer.
